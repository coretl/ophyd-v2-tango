Add exception case to wait_for_not_moving for when the state is e.g. in alarm state, right now it only check if not moving
Rewrite TangoSignal etc to derive from the ophyd Signal classes
implement observe monitor member functions etc
More rigorous testing about async vs sync green mode overhead
Rewrite ConnectTheRest to be callable as a function as type-checkable. Tom recommends implementing as a function and instatiating a class instance if required. Says he only implemented the protocol EpicsConnector for type checking reasons.
Implement other connectors I haven't rewritten yet
Write unit tests that utilise real (no hardware but actually running on Tango) devices 
Write class to mock output of AsyncDeviceProxy for unit tests.
Cleanup sync proxy remnants. Ctrl+F for "sync"
<!-- Change type hint for get_tango_connector to be TangoConnector -->
Consider if there is a better way to implement _get_dtype
How do we implement "source" for commands and pipes? These need not have unique names, can have an attr+command with same name
Implement DISCONNECTED_ERROR for tango 
Use Reading and Descriptor type hints from protocols.py
Decide how to handle raised Exceptions. Specify exceptions more
TangoAttr.connect(): what exception type?
Inherit from Signal for Pipe and add put to W version
make a plan that can handle pipes/anything not just scalar (look into bluesky plans designed to handle 2-3D data.)
None/null json type not encouraged by Dtype bluesky protocol. Also missing "object" and there is strange separation of "number" and "integer"
Most likely need to rename the __connect__ method in Comm
wait_for_not_moving should likely be set in the motor device level, using observe_monitor from TangoAttrR, then we have to have Position as TangoAttrRW to have put and observe_reading
Closer look at TangoMonitor
Need to use put_nowait as Tom said. See q.py in zzztestingstuff


UNIT TEST IDEAS:
putting a value to an attribute that is beyond the max or min value of the device
Setting velocity to zero and waiting for timeout
asserting that we can pass Tango device to built in callbacks (not yet implemented)
assert dtype of descriptor is correct
ensure that async put and reads are non blocking
