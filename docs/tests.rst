The tango_ophyd_device repository comes packaged with three test files designed to be run with unittest.
These are

+ test_sim_proxy.py
+ test_example_device.py
+ test_sardana_motor.py

The first of these can be run without any background processes, provided that the bluesky and ophyd.v2 packages are installed.
